# Ownership Status Update Improvements

## Issue Description

The ownership status was not updating immediately when collections were loaded, causing users to see incorrect ownership information (e.g., "OWNED" badges not appearing, ability to bid on their own tokens, etc.).

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. **Race Condition**: The `checkUserOwnership()` function relied on `ownerAddress` data from the collection object, which was populated during `fetchCollectionData()` using blockchain calls that might return stale data.

2. **Stale Blockchain Data**: When collections were loaded, the `ownerOf` calls during data fetching could return outdated ownership information if:
   - Recent purchases/transfers had just occurred
   - Blockchain state hadn't fully propagated across RPC nodes
   - The RPC provider's cache was outdated

3. **Timing Issues**: Ownership checks ran immediately when collection data was set, but this data might not reflect the most current blockchain state.

### Code Flow Issues
```typescript
// 1. Collection loads with potentially stale ownerAddress data
fetchCollectionData() // Sets ownerAddress from blockchain calls

// 2. Ownership check runs immediately using this potentially stale data  
useEffect(() => {
  if (collection) {
    checkUserOwnership(); // Uses collection.evmCollectionTokens[].ownerAddress
  }
}, [collection]);
```

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Forced Blockchain Refresh After Collection Load
```typescript
// Effect to fetch price statistics when collection is loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (collection) {
    fetchPriceStatistics();
    checkUserOwnership();
    
    // Force a fresh blockchain ownership check after a short delay
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain();
    }, 1000); // 1-second delay for better responsiveness
  }
}, [collection]);
```

**Why this helps:**
- Ensures fresh blockchain data is fetched after initial load
- The delay allows for blockchain state propagation
- `refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain()` makes direct `ownerOf` calls for each token

### 2. Improved Periodic Refresh Strategy
```typescript
// More frequent refreshes when wallet is connected
const refreshInterval = isEvmWalletConnected ? 15000 : 30000; // 15s vs 30s

const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
  if (isEvmWalletConnected) {
    await refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain(); // Direct blockchain calls
  } else {
    checkUserOwnership(); // Use cached data
  }
}, refreshInterval);
```

**Why this helps:**
- More frequent updates when users are actively interacting (wallet connected)
- Aggressive blockchain checking only when needed
- Reduces unnecessary blockchain calls for passive users

### 3. Enhanced Post-Transaction Refresh
The existing post-transaction refresh was already well-implemented:
```typescript
// After successful purchase
await fetchCollectionData();
await fetchPriceStatistics();

setTimeout(async () => {
  await refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain();
}, 3000); // Allows time for blockchain finality
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement Real-time Updates
Consider adding WebSocket connections or blockchain event listeners:
```typescript
// Example: Listen for Transfer events
const filter = {
  address: PLATZ_LAND_NFT_ADDRESS,
  topics: [
    '0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef', // Transfer event
    null, // from
    connectedEvmAddress // to (user's address)
  ]
};

publicClient.watchEvent({
  filter,
  onLogs: (logs) => {
    // Refresh ownership when user receives tokens
    refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain();
  }
});
```

### 2. Add Loading States for Ownership Updates
```typescript
const [isRefreshingOwnership, setIsRefreshingOwnership] = useState(false);

const refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain = async () => {
  setIsRefreshingOwnership(true);
  try {
    // ... existing logic
  } finally {
    setIsRefreshingOwnership(false);
  }
};
```

### 3. Implement Optimistic Updates
For immediate feedback on user actions:
```typescript
const handlePurchaseToken = (tokenId: string) => {
  // Optimistically update ownership
  setOwnedTokenIds(prev => new Set([...prev, tokenId]));
  
  // Proceed with purchase...
};
```

### 4. Cache Invalidation Strategy
Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy:
```typescript
const ownershipCache = new Map<string, { owner: string, timestamp: number }>();
const CACHE_TTL = 30000; // 30 seconds

const getCachedOwnership = (tokenId: string) => {
  const cached = ownershipCache.get(tokenId);
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_TTL) {
    return cached.owner;
  }
  return null;
};
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current Impact
- **Blockchain Calls**: Additional `ownerOf` calls after collection load
- **Network Traffic**: More frequent ownership checks when wallet connected
- **User Experience**: Better accuracy at cost of some additional RPC calls

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Batch Ownership Calls**: Use multicall contracts for efficiency
2. **Smart Caching**: Cache ownership data with TTL and invalidation
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Subscribe to blockchain events instead of polling
4. **Progressive Loading**: Load ownership data in background while showing UI

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Fresh Page Load**: Verify ownership appears within 2-3 seconds
2. **Recent Purchase**: Complete purchase, verify ownership updates immediately  
3. **External Transfer**: Transfer token externally, verify UI updates within 15s
4. **Wallet Switch**: Change wallets, verify ownership recalculates correctly
5. **Network Issues**: Test behavior with slow/failed RPC calls

### Performance Monitoring
- Track `refreshOwnershipFromBlockchain()` execution time
- Monitor RPC call frequency and success rates
- Measure time-to-ownership-display metrics

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly reduce the ownership status update delay by:
1. **Immediate Fresh Data**: Forced refresh after collection load
2. **Adaptive Polling**: More frequent updates for active users
3. **Direct Blockchain Queries**: Bypassing potentially stale cached data

The changes maintain performance while providing much more responsive ownership status updates, especially critical for NFT marketplace functionality where ownership accuracy is essential for user experience and security.
