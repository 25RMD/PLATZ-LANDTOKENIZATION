# Ownership and Bidding System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Individual Token Ownership Detection

**Problem**: The system was incorrectly treating collection creators as owners of all tokens in the collection, when individual tokens can have different owners.

**Solution**: 
- **Removed COLLECTION_CREATOR ownership logic** from `app/api/collections/user-owned/route.ts`
- **Created new API endpoint** `/api/collections/[collectionId]/ownership` for accurate individual token ownership checking
- **Updated frontend** `mainpages/NFTCollectionDetailPage.tsx` to use the new individual token ownership API
- **Implemented proper token-level ownership detection** based on actual `ownerAddress` in the database

**Before**: User showed ownership of all 10 tokens in collection 16 (incorrectly)
**After**: User shows ownership of 0 tokens in collection 16 (correctly)

### 2. Orders Page - Received Bids Section

**Problem**: 
- Tab was labeled "All Received Bids" but should be "Received Bids"
- API was returning both bids made by the user AND bids received by the user
- Should only show bids received on items actually owned by the user

**Solution**:
- **Fixed tab label** from "All Received Bids" to "Received Bids" in `app/orders/page.tsx`
- **Updated API logic** in `app/api/bids/received/route.ts` to only return bids received on listings owned by the user
- **Removed user's own bids** from the received bids section
- **Updated analytics section title** to match new label

### 3. Frontend Token Sorting and Visual Indicators

**Problem**: Owned tokens were mixed with non-owned tokens, making it hard to distinguish ownership.

**Solution** (from previous implementation):
- **Smart token sorting**: Owned tokens are moved to the bottom while preserving original token ID order
- **Visual ownership indicators**: "OWNED" badges, yellow borders, reduced opacity for owned tokens
- **Disabled bidding** for owned tokens with clear "You own this" messaging
- **Case-insensitive address matching** for robust ownership detection

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/collections/[collectionId]/ownership?userAddress=ADDRESS` - Check individual token ownership for a specific collection

### Updated Endpoints
- `GET /api/collections/user-owned?userAddress=ADDRESS` - Now only returns collections where user owns individual tokens (removed collection creator logic)
- `GET /api/bids/received?userAddress=ADDRESS` - Now only returns bids received on user's owned listings (not bids they made)

## Database Schema

No database changes were required. The fixes use existing data structures more accurately:
- `evmCollectionToken.ownerAddress` - For individual token ownership
- `landListing.user` - For listing ownership (used in received bids)

## Key Principles Implemented

1. **Individual Token Ownership**: Each token in a collection can have a different owner
2. **Collection Creation ≠ Token Ownership**: Creating a collection doesn't automatically mean owning all tokens
3. **Accurate Bid Filtering**: "Received Bids" only shows bids on items the user actually owns
4. **Clear Visual Distinction**: UI clearly shows which tokens are owned vs available for bidding

## Testing

### Collection 16 with Address 0x6BE90E278ff81b25e2E48351c346886F8F50e99e:

**Individual Token Ownership API**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "collectionId": "16",
    "totalTokens": 0,
    "ownedTokens": [],
    "ownership": {
      "totalOwned": 0,
      "ownershipPercentage": 0,
      "ownedTokenIds": []
    }
  }
}
```

**User-Owned Collections API**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "collections": [],
  "metadata": {
    "totalCollections": 0,
    "totalItemsOwned": 0
  }
}
```

**Received Bids API**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bids": [6 bids received on user's listings],
  "metadata": {
    "totalReceivedBids": 6
  }
}
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `app/api/collections/user-owned/route.ts` - Removed collection creator logic
2. `app/api/collections/[collectionId]/ownership/route.ts` - New individual token ownership API
3. `app/api/bids/received/route.ts` - Fixed to only return bids received on user's listings
4. `mainpages/NFTCollectionDetailPage.tsx` - Updated to use new ownership API
5. `app/orders/page.tsx` - Fixed tab labels and analytics titles

### Key Functions Added:
- `checkUserOwnership()` - Now uses individual token ownership API
- Individual token ownership endpoint with detailed ownership statistics
- Proper bid filtering for received bids only

## Expected Behavior

### Collection Detail Page:
- ✅ Only tokens actually owned by the user show "OWNED" badges
- ✅ Only tokens not owned by the user can be bid on
- ✅ Visual distinction between owned and available tokens
- ✅ Accurate ownership percentage calculation

### Orders Page:
- ✅ "Received Bids" tab shows only bids received on user's owned items
- ✅ Clear separation between bids made vs bids received
- ✅ Accurate analytics for received bids

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. **Ownership detection is accurate** - based on actual token ownership, not collection creation
2. **Bidding system works correctly** - users can only bid on tokens they don't own
3. **Orders page is clearer** - proper separation of bid types
4. **UI is consistent** - ownership indicators match actual ownership
5. **Data integrity** - APIs return accurate, filtered data
