# Scripts Documentation

This directory contains maintenance and utility scripts for the PLATZ Land Tokenization platform.

## Get Earliest Listings Script

### Purpose
The `get-earliest-listings.js` and `get-earliest-listings.ts` scripts fetch the 2 earliest listings from the database, providing detailed information about the oldest land listings in the system.

### Usage

#### JavaScript Version
```bash
node scripts/get-earliest-listings.js
```

#### TypeScript Version
```bash
npx tsx scripts/get-earliest-listings.ts
```

### Output
The script displays:
- **Listing Details**: ID, title, address, location, price, status
- **Blockchain Info**: Collection ID, token ID, mint status
- **User Info**: Owner username/email
- **Timestamps**: Creation and update dates
- **Database Statistics**: Total listings count and age of oldest listing

### Example Output
```
🔍 Fetching the 2 earliest listings from the database...

✅ Found 2 earliest listing(s):

📋 Listing #1:
   ID: cmb2wcefj0000czlrzwoxaitp
   Title: Serene Hilltop plot #1
   Address: No address
   Location: No location
   Price: 0.0001 ETH
   Status: PENDING
   Mint Status: COMPLETED_COLLECTION
   Collection ID: 15
   Token ID: Not minted
   Owner: bidder_user
   Created: 2025-05-25T00:04:34.447Z
   Updated: 2025-05-31T20:34:20.755Z

📊 Database Statistics:
   Total listings in database: 7
   Oldest listing created: 31 days ago
```

## User Consolidation Script

### Purpose
The `consolidate-duplicate-users.ts` script identifies and merges duplicate user records that have the same Ethereum address but different casing (e.g., `0xABC...` vs `0xabc...`). This ensures data consistency and prevents ownership issues.

### Problem Solved
Due to case sensitivity differences in how Ethereum addresses were stored, some users had multiple records in the database:
- `0x3ec4bfe3167ba77A5906C034AABE5537BA7c4B07` (mixed case)
- `0x3ec4bfe3167ba77a5906c034aabe5537ba7c4b07` (lowercase)

This caused the `/api/collections/user-owned` endpoint to show incorrect collection counts.

### Usage

#### Safe Testing (Recommended First)
```bash
# Dry run - shows what would be done without making changes
npm run consolidate-users:dry-run
```

#### Production Execution
```bash
# Full consolidation with automatic backup
npm run consolidate-users

# Consolidation without backup (not recommended)
npm run consolidate-users:no-backup
```

### How It Works

1. **Identifies Duplicates**: Finds all users with the same EVM address (case-insensitive)

2. **Selects Primary User**: Uses smart prioritization:
   - Admin users first
   - KYC verified users
   - Users with complete profile data
   - Users with most activity (listings, bids, etc.)
   - Oldest user (earliest `createdAt`)

3. **Consolidates Data**: Updates all related records to point to primary user:
   - Land Listings
   - NFT Bids
   - Watchlist items (handles conflicts intelligently)
   - Offers (made and received)
   - Trades (bought, sold, created)
   - Properties
   - KYC Update Requests

4. **Merges Profile Data**: Combines user profile information, keeping the best available data

5. **Cleanup**: Deletes duplicate user records after successful consolidation

### Safety Features

- **Automatic Backup**: Creates timestamped backup before any changes
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test safely without making changes
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what will be done
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles duplicate watchlist items gracefully
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses database transactions for data integrity
- **Rollback Support**: Backup files can be used for manual rollback if needed

### Output Example

```
🚀 Starting user consolidation process...
💾 Creating backup of user data...
✅ Backup created: /path/to/backups/backup-users-2025-05-27T00-10-11-112Z.json

📊 Found 1 groups of duplicate users:
1. Address: 0x3ec4bfe3167ba77a5906c034aabe5537ba7c4b07
   Primary: admin user (45 listings)
   Duplicate: test user (1 listing)

📋 Consolidating 2 users...
   ✅ Updated 1 land listings
   ✅ Updated 2 KYC requests
   ✅ Merged profile data
   🗑️  Deleted 1 duplicate user

✅ User consolidation completed successfully!
```

### Backup Location
Backups are stored in `/backups/backup-users-[timestamp].json`

### When to Run
- After identifying duplicate user issues
- During database maintenance
- Before major user-related updates
- When ownership data appears inconsistent

### Monitoring
The script provides detailed statistics about:
- Number of duplicate groups found
- Total users consolidated
- Records updated per table
- Users deleted

This information helps verify the consolidation was successful and complete.
